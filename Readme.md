# Where did the time go?  
For my visual rhetoric project， I want to focus the fast passage of time calling everyone to cherish it. In our daily life, we may often think of the question that "Where did the time go?". It seems that the time has always been passing so fast and so quiet that the thought "What!? I have already grown up!" strikes to my mind. Inadvertently, as time passed, each of us grew up quietly.  
To show this, I want to use the scenery of the four season of a year to be the main part of my project symbolizing the pass of the time as well as a life of a person, adding the element of clock, sandglass, and old things old sceneries such as the playground of my middle school time. I will use "Where did the time go?" to be the title of my project with the biggest word size, and there will be lines of thought relative to time in the project.

I have found some picture for my project and tried to connect them together. I ahve found the four season's picture which are representing the time passing, and some of which are from the website, some of which are from the pictures I take. I also find the picture for clock and so on. I changes the transparency of some pictures, and sorted them in a logical way. I also added a title to my project.

  I cut the images of the calendar and the sandglass out of the previous images and lay it on the top of the layers. I also cjanges the typr of the words. Besides that I merge the edge of the four season pictures as I make the edge of gradual change with a greyscale mask also using the pen brush to make the edge merge more natural. I also add some sentences to the picture to make it more meaningful.
