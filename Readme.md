# Where did the time go?  
For my visual rhetoric project， I want to focus the fast passage of time calling everyone to cherish it. In our daily life, we may often think of the question that "Where did the time go?". It seems that the time has always been passing so fast and so quiet that the thought "What!? I have already grown up!" strikes to my mind. Inadvertently, as time passed, each of us grew up quietly.  
To show this, I want to use the scenery of the four season of a year to be the main part of my project symbolizing the pass of the time as well as a life of a person, adding the element of clock, sandglass, and old things old sceneries such as the playground of my middle school time. I will use "Where did the time go?" to be the title of my project with the biggest word size, and there will be lines of thought relative to time in the project.

I have found some picture for my project and tried to connect them together. I ahve found the four season's picture which are representing the time passing, and some of which are from the website, some of which are from the pictures I take. I also find the picture for clock and so on. I changes the transparency of some pictures, and sorted them in a logical way. I also added a title to my project.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad7803b6-c00b-48c7-be89-1ddffe96c085)


  I cut the images of the calendar and the sandglass out of the previous images and lay it on the top of the layers. I also cjanges the typr of the words. Besides that I merge the edge of the four season pictures as I make the edge of gradual change with a greyscale mask also using the pen brush to make the edge merge more natural. I also add some sentences to the picture to make it more meaningful.

**reflections:**  
At first, I think of a lot of topic I might want to choose. From my perspective, I think my pass happy moments with my family are the most thing I wants to cherish in my life, and I am a very very nostalgia person, so I choose the topic of time. Sometimes, I would think of time is passing so fast that in the blink of eye I grew up. People who have all sorts of feelings well up in their mind about their time their past will be very resonate with my design, which also call on them to cherish their time. As I was constructing the base form of my project, I wants too add a lot of things to it, like the clock the calendar and so on. To express time, the four season of a year comes to my mind that the four season are a cycle, think of a clock with one year as the unit. The transition of seasons is like time constantly flowing away. Besides that, the are moments and things that represent the time passing, like the clock, the calendar, the sandglass and so on. I also use the old things like the playground we used to play on and the book that we work on in the past to represent the pass time we own before.  
To construct my project, I use the white color for the background as I will use other pictures with semitransparency and a white background can be a very good choice for background lighting up the whole tone of my project. Upon it is a layer group with the pictures of four season connecting together in a loop in the order of spring summer fall and winter representing the time of year. For those ones, I use a mask of every season to make them connect naturally, and for the mask, I use gradients for the edge of each picture to make them merge better. I also use brushes to brush the edge to each picture to merge them in a more nature way on the masks.

Upon this layer is a layer of the image of clock, I lower down the transparency and extract out the black part of the clock to make the logo of clock more clearer but not that out standing.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf95b45b-5928-4dc4-ac7a-36ff2aded68e)  
Beyond that, I use the fuzzy selection tool and free zone tool to extract the image of the sand glass, the calendar, the playground and the writing book part of of their previous images that are listed in the asset and change their size to better fit in the project. I also change the transparency of the images so that they will mot turn back the four season part and also able to figure out what I want to express.

Then are the words that I add to the project. "Where did time go?" is the largest one and also the thickest front in the project, to highlight the topic I want to express. And the several lines are sentences that helps to better express the topic calling on people to cherish time. I arranged them in the shape of falling leaves like the time that has passed. I choose a font that matches will to my topic or say style I also arrange the words into a through dyslexia-friendly fonts and high contrast for people with visual impairments considering accessibility in my design.

**Baseline criteria:**
I use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, contrast to focus and guide viewers' attention, as what I arrange the images and lines in my project. I also use the reflection to clarify your compositional choices and goals as in this file.  
I have a clear message or intervention that you can articulate in your reflection, like my title "Where did time go?" and the lines include in my design.  
I include words, and choose a font that matches the style/tone of my piece.  
I credit all assets correctly, including attribution (creator names) where required.  
I use at least 3 layers.
I use at least 1 tool beyond select, move, and text, like the fuzzy selection tool and free zone tool and so on.  
I use non-default commit messages that say what's changing (and maybe even why).  
I meet deadlines and requirements from the assignment page (see: reflection with screenshots and at least 500 words, project title in README).  
**Aspirational inspirations:**  
I organize my files through layer labeling, layer groups, repo structure like the four season group.  
I use multiple design strategies in ways that compliment each other, like the mask the transparency the balance of the design and so on.  
I refer to assigned readings in explaining my design choices, like the font pairings, hierarchical levels.  
I make my design bright and bold to make your work pop and draw the eye as the color of the whole tone is light and pleasant.  
I make my project subtle and crafty to make your work reveal itself only gradually, as people may gradually get caught on different elements of my design.  
I choose a font that matches will to my topic or say style I also arrange the words into a through dyslexia-friendly fonts and high contrast for people with visual impairments considering accessibility in my design.  
I use more than 3 distinct overlapping layers.  
I use more than 3 tools beyond select, move, and text that are new to me, like the mask layer and how to merge the edge of the images and the fuzzy selection tool and free zone tool and the gradients and the saturation to make the picture in a way I want to better express my topic and to fit in to the project.  
I demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at my piece can accurately articulate my message/argument.  
I demonstrate through feedback that someone looking at your piece can accurately describe your intended audience.  
**Peer reviews:**

I take the advice of making some of the words a little clearer, maybe with a different font as previously some of my words are a little fade and hard to read and I change them so they can be better for people to read especially for people with vision problems.

This are similar.

In my previous draft the balance are not that will, so I add elements and rearrange them again, also change the font of my lines to better balance my design.
