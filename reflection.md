## Project:Where did time go?
**introduction:**  
For my visual rhetoric projectï¼Œ I want to focus the fast passage of time calling everyone to cherish it. In our daily life, we may often think of the question that "Where did the time go?". It seems that the time has always been passing so fast and so quiet that the thought "What!? I have already grown up!" strikes to my mind. Inadvertently, as time passed, each of us grew up quietly.  
To show this, I want to use the scenery of the four season of a year to be the main part of my project symbolizing the pass of the time as well as a life of a person, adding the element of clock, sandglass, and old things old sceneries such as the playground of my middle school time. I will use "Where did the time go?" to be the title of my project with the biggest word size, and there will be lines of thought relative to time in the project.  
**reflections:**  
At first, I think of a lot of topic I might want to choose. From my perspective, I think my pass happy moments with my family are the most thing I wants to cherish in my life, and I am a very very nostalgia person, so I choose the topic of time. Somtimes, I would think of time is passing so fast that in the blink of eye I grew up. As I was constructing the base form of my project, I wants too add a lot of things to it, like the clock the calendar and so on.To express time, the four season of a year comes to my mind that the four season are a cycle, think of a clock with one year as the unit. The transition of seasons is like time constantly flowing away. Besides that, the are moments and things that represent the time passing, like the clock, the calendar, the sandglass and so on. I also use the old things like the playground we used to play on and the book that we work on in the past to represent the pass time we own before.  
To construct my project, I use the white color for the background as I will use other pictures with semitransparency and a white backgroud can be a very good choice for background lighting up the whole tone of my project. Upon it is a layer group with the pictures of four season connecting together in a loope in the order of spring summer fall and winter representing the time of year.
